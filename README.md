# matplotpp
**MATPLOT++** is a Matlab like simple plotting framework in C++. In cases where you need to make plots of data generated in C/C++, `matplotpp` enables you to generate 2D/3D plots, histograms, scatterplots, etc, just by adding a few lines of code, without any external plotting tool such as MATLAB or Gnuplot.

MATPLOT++ features are the following:
* MATLAB like command set.
* Cross platform compatibility on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. `matplotpp` is based on **OpenGL/GLUT** which is a simple cross-platform windowing **API**.
* High quality vector output: PS, EPS, PDF, and SVG.

# Note
This repository is a fork of the [matplotpp](https://code.google.com/p/matplotpp/) library by **Yuichi Katori**. The repository is not maintained. It is merely a modified version of the project that uses `cmake`.
